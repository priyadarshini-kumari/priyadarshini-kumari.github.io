I am a Research Scientist at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/). 

My research is motivated by the goal of <i>modeling</i> and <i>synthesizing</i> a multisensory (vision, speech, haptic, olfaction, and taste) perception system using machine learning tools. To achieve data efficiency, I also work on developing <i>active learning</i> algorithms to reduce the annotation load in supervised methods. So far, I've applied my research primarily in computer vision and haptics applications, such as object retrieval, recommendation systems, and haptic texture recognition, but I've also been motivated by other machine senses such as olfaction and taste.

Previously, I received my Ph.D. from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) and [Prof. Siddhartha Chaudhuri](cse.iitb.ac.in/~sidch/). My thesis was on <i>Label-Efficient Metric Learning</i>. 

Before that, I completed my master's also from IIT Bombay. As a part of my master's thesis, I developed multimodal rendering techniques to synthesize a combined hapto-visual-auditory perceptual experience of interaction with 3D models of heritage sites. The goal was to provide access to heritage objects to visually-impaired people.
