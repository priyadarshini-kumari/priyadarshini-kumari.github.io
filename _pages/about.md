I am a Research Scientist at [Sony Research](https://ai.sony/). 

My research aims to create scalable, data-efficient models that continuously learn, adapt, and ensure interpretability in decision processes. My work has explored the applicability of these models in various domains, including biomedical research for scientific discoveries, the design of recommendation systems, and the development of multimodal perception models encompassing vision, speech, and olfactory inputs.


<!-- My research is motivated by the goal of <i>modeling</i> and <i>synthesizing</i>  a multimodal perception system using ML tools. To achieve data efficiency, I also work on developing <i>active and transfer learning</i> algorithms for data-scarce domains, including biomedical, computer vision, natural language processing, and AI for science applications. -->

<!-- My research is motivated by the goal of <i>modeling</i> and <i>synthesizing</i> a multisensory (vision, speech, haptic, olfaction, and taste) perception system using machine learning tools. To achieve data efficiency, I also work on developing <i>active learning</i> algorithms to reduce the annotation load in supervised methods.  -->

Previously, I received my Ph.D. from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), advised by [Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/main/main.html) and [Prof. Siddhartha Chaudhuri](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sidch/). My thesis was on <i>Label-Efficient Distance Metric Learning</i>. Before that, I completed my master's also from IIT Bombay. As a part of my master's thesis, I developed multimodal rendering techniques to synthesize a combined hapto-visual-auditory perceptual experience of interaction with 3D models of heritage sites. The goal was to provide access to heritage objects to visually-impaired people.
