Perceptual metric learning is a concept in machine learning where algorithms are designed to learn a distance metric that captures the perceptual similarity between data points. It aims to model human perception by encoding the relationships and similarities that align with how humans perceive the data. This learned metric can then be used for tasks like image and video retrieval, where the goal is to measure the perceptual difference between visual content accurately. Perceptual metric learning enhances the effectiveness of various applications by enabling more meaningful and human-like comparisons between data points.
