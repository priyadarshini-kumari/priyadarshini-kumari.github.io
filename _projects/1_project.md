Computational haptics is a field focused on using computer algorithms and technology to simulate and generate tactile sensations, or haptic feedback. This involves creating realistic touch experiences in virtual environments, digital interfaces, and applications like virtual reality, medical simulations, gaming, and training. It encompasses haptic rendering algorithms, specialized devices, and user interface enhancements, enhancing immersion and interaction by mimicking the sense of touch.

To this end, my work explores BLAH
