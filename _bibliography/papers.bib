  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={
  Active metric learning is the problem of incrementally selecting highutility batches of training data (typically, ordered triplets) to annotate, in order
to progressively improve a learned model of a metric over some input domain as
rapidly as possible. Standard approaches, which independently assess the informativeness of each triplet in a batch, are susceptible to highly correlated batches
with many redundant triplets and hence low overall utility. While a recent work [20] proposes batch-decorrelation strategies for metric learning, they rely on
ad hoc heuristics to estimate the correlation between two triplets at a time. We
present a novel batch active metric learning method that leverages the Maximum Entropy Principle to learn the least biased estimate of triplet distribution
for a given set of prior constraints. To avoid redundancy between triplets, our
method collectively selects batches with maximum joint entropy, which simultaneously captures both informativeness and diversity. We take advantage of the
submodularity of the joint entropy function to construct a tractable solution using
an efficient greedy algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization that is
provably optimal. Our approach is the first batch active metric learning
method to define a unified score that balances informativeness and diversity for
an entire batch of triplets. Experiments with several real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is robust, generalizes well to different applications and
input modalities, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art},
