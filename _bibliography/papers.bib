  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={Discriminative features are crucial for several learning applications, such as object detection and classification. Neural networks are extensively used for extracting discriminative features of images and speech signals. However, the lack of large datasets in the haptics domain often limits the applicability of such techniques. This paper presents a general framework for the analysis of the discriminative properties of haptic signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral features and a boosted embedding technique in enhancing the distinguishability of haptic signals. Experiments indicate our framework needs less training data, generalizes well for different predictors, and outperforms the related state-of-the-art.},

  title={A Unified Batch Selection Policy for Active Metric Learning},
  author={Priyadarshini, K and Chaudhuri, Siddhartha and Borkar, Vivek and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  booktitle = {ECML-PKDD},
  abstract = {Active metric learning is the problem of incrementally selecting high-utility batches of 
  training data (typically, ordered triplets) to annotate, in order to 
  progressively improve a learned model of a metric over some input domain 
  as rapidly as possible. Standard approaches, which independently assess 
  the informativeness of each triplet in a batch, are susceptible to highly 
  correlated batches with many redundant triplets and hence low overall utility. 
  While a recent work proposes batch-decorrelation strategies for metric 
  learning, they rely on ad hoc heuristics to estimate the correlation between 
  two triplets at a time. We present a novel batch active metric learning method 
  that leverages the Maximum Entropy Principle to learn the least biased 
  estimate of triplet distribution for a given set of prior constraints. 
  To avoid redundancy between triplets, our method collectively selects batches 
  with maximum joint entropy, which simultaneously captures both informativeness 
  and diversity. We take advantage of the submodularity of the joint entropy 
  function to construct a tractable solution using an efficient greedy 
  algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization that is provably 
  (1‚àí\frac{1}{ùëí})-optimal. Our approach is the first batch active metric learning 
  method to define a unified score that balances informativeness and diversity 
  for an entire batch of triplets. Experiments with several real-world datasets 
  demonstrate that our algorithm is robust, generalizes well to different 
  applications and input modalities, and consistently outperforms the 
  state-of-the-art.},

  title={Batch decorrelation for active metric learning},
  author={Kumari, Priyadarshini and Goru, Ritesh and Chaudhuri, Siddhartha and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  abstract = {We present an active learning strategy for training parametric 
  models of distance metrics, given triplet-based similarity assessments: 
  object xi is more similar to object xj than to xk. In contrast to prior 
  work on class-based learning, where the fundamental goal is classification 
  and any implicit or explicit metric is binary, we focus on perceptual 
  metrics that express the degree of (dis) similarity between objects. 
  We find that standard active learning approaches degrade when annotations 
  are requested for batches of triplets at a time: our studies suggest that 
  correlation among triplets is responsible. In this work, we propose a novel 
  method to decorrelate batches of triplets, that jointly balances 
  informativeness and diversity while decoupling the choice of heuristic 
  for each criterion. Experiments indicate our method is general, adaptable, 
  and outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

  title={PerceptNet: Learning perceptual similarity of haptic textures in presence of unorderable triplets},
  author={Priyadarshini, Kumari and Chaudhuri, Siddhartha and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  abstract = {In order to design haptic icons or build a haptic vocabulary, 
  we require a set of easily distinguishable haptic signals to avoid perceptual 
  ambiguity, which in turn requires a way to accurately estimate the perceptual 
  (dis)similarity of such signals. In this work, we present a novel method to 
  learn such a perceptual metric based on data from human studies. Our method 
  is based on a deep neural network that projects signals to an embedding 
  space where the natural Euclidean distance accurately models the degree 
  of dissimilarity between two signals. The network is trained only on 
  non-numerical comparisons of triplets of signals, using a novel triplet 
  loss that considers both types of triplets that are easy to order 
  (inequality constraints), as well as those that are unorderable/ambiguous 
  (equality constraints). Unlike prior MDS-based non-parametric approaches, 
  our method can be trained on a partial set of comparisons and can embed 
  new haptic signals without retraining the model from scratch. Extensive 
  experimental evaluations show that our method is significantly more 
  effective at modeling perceptual dissimilarity than alternatives.},

  author={Kumari, Priyadarshini and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  abstract = {In real world, we often come across with soft objects having 
  spatially varying stiffness such as human palm or a wart on the skin. 
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to render thin, deformable objects having spatially varying stiffness (inhomogeneous material). We use the classical Kirchhoff thin plate theory to compute the deformation. In general, physics based rendering of an arbitrary 3D surface is complex and time consuming. Therefore, we approximate the 3D surface locally by a 2D plane using an area preserving mapping technique - Gall-Peters mapping. Once the deformation is computed by solving a fourth order partial differential equation, we project the points back onto the original object for proper haptic rendering. The method was validated through user experiments and was found to be realistic.},

  author={Aniyath, Praseedha Krishnan and Gopalan, Sreeni Kamalalayam and Kumari, Priyadarshini and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  abstract = {In this work, we develop a multi-modal rendering framework
comprising of hapto-visual and auditory data. The prime focus is to
haptically render point cloud data representing virtual 3-D models of
cultural significance and also to handle their affine transformations. Cultural heritage objects could potentially be very large and one may be
required to render the object at various scales of details. Further, surface
effects such as texture and friction are incorporated in order to provide
a realistic haptic perception to the users. Moreover, the proposed framework includes an appropriate sound synthesis to bring out the acoustic
properties of the object. It also includes a graphical user interface with
varied options such as choosing the desired orientation of 3-D objects
and selecting the desired level of spatial resolution adaptively at runtime. A fast, point proxy-based haptic rendering technique is proposed
with proxy update loop running 100 times faster than the required haptic update frequency of 1 kHz. The surface properties are integrated in
the system by applying a bilateral filter on the depth data of the virtual
3-D models. Position dependent sound synthesis is incorporated with the
incorporation of appropriate audio clips.},

  author={Kumari, Priyadarshini and Sreeni, KG and Chaudhuri, Subhasis},
  booktitle={IEEE World Haptics Conference (WHC)},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel proxy based method of adaptive
haptic rendering of a variable density 3D point cloud data at different levels of detail without pre-computing the mesh structure.
We also incorporate features like rotation, translation and friction
to provide a better realistic experience to the user. A proxy based
rendering technique is used to avoid the pop-through problem while
rendering thin parts of the object. Instead of a point proxy, a spherical proxy of variable radius is used which avoids the sinking of
proxy during the haptic interaction of sparse data. The radius of
the proxy is adaptively varied depending upon the local density of
the point data using kernel bandwidth estimation. During the interaction, the proxy moves in small steps tangentially over the point
cloud such that the new position always minimizes the distance between the proxy and the haptic interaction point (HIP). The raw
point cloud data re-sampled in a regular 3D lattice of voxels are
loaded to the haptic space after proper smoothing to avoid aliasing effects. The rendering technique is experimented with several
subjects and it is observed that this functionality supplements the
user‚Äôs experience by allowing the user to interact with an object at
multiple resolutions.},

Our main focus is to provide a haptic access of artistic objects of any physical scale to the differently abled people. This is a low-cost system and, in conjunction with a stereoscopic visual display, gives a better immersive experience even to the sighted persons. To achieve this, we propose a simple multilevel, proxy-based hapto-visual rendering technique for point cloud data which includes the much desired scalability feature which enables the users to change the scale of the objects adaptively during the haptic interaction. For the proposed haptic rendering technique the proxy updation loop runs at a rate 100 times faster than the required haptic updation frequency of 1KHz. We observe that this functionality augments very well to the realism of the experience.},
